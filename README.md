This was a game I coded with Java in my Object-Oriented Design class. It features three versions of Marble Solitaire: English, European, and Triangular boards, all implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The game includes customizable board sizes and starting positions. I wrote JUnit tests to ensure all game logic and functionality work correctly.

Features:
- English, European, and Triangular Marble Solitaire variants.
- Command-line interface for selecting board types, sizes, and initial positions.
- Thorough test coverage using JUnit.
